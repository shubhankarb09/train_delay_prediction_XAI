# Train Delay Prediction using Random Forest, KNN, Deep Learning and Explaining the Factors Affecting Delays using Explainable AI
Train delays have been a common occurrence in the German railways often leading to
missed connections, missed appointments and other inconveniences to the passengers.
Delay predictions of trains can be carried out by making use of machine learning algorithms
such as Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbours and Deep Learning along with
General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. The factors impacting delays can be
then determined by using Explainable AI methods such as LIME and SHAP. 

# Overview of the project
Real-time GTFS data from Deutsche Bahn was first collected over a duration of 4 weeks, processed,
the features were isolated, and samples of 10 railway lines were filtered for data
analysis. Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors and Deep Learning was then used to
train the samples. The training phase was then followed by utilizing explainable AI methods
of LIME and SHAP which helped in determining the effect of each factor and the
factor with the most effect in causing the delay. With the results that were generated, the
importance and usefulness of GTFS data, paired with machine learning and XAI in delay
prediction was highlighted. 

# Possible improvement/Limitation
With larger datasets which include historical data, there is
massive potential to find out causes of train delays on a larger scale.
